CrossFire Fitness is a ministry that my wife and I both strongly believe in. 
Based out of Bristol, VA they provide a great opportunity for the local youth 
to begin and pursue a healthy lifestyle. All of this is done free-of-charge,
and is centered around honoring Jesus Christ.

I was honored to volunteer my time to build a website and help further establish their
web presence. One of my favorite parts of this project was creating the background collage
from their Facebook photos.
