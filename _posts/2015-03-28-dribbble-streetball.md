Streetball was a side project I created in 2012 to experiment with live data from the dribbble api. 
I expanded on their basketball theme by pairing two players up against one another and analyzing their "stats".
There really is no clear winner, as this is intended just for friendly competition.
But as you can see in the screenshot, I just got schooled by a legend.
