My responsibilities at FreightCenter revolved almost entirely around development;
building new features, and maintaining an existing code base. Whenever I designed 
something it was typically in the sense of architecting and planning new software solutions.

For overall user interface and graphic design strategy
I coordinated heavily with our talented Creative Director, <a href="http://justinlangley.com/">Justin Langley</a>.
He's mostly responsible for what you see in the application screenshot.
I contributed design feedback and handled most of the implementation.
