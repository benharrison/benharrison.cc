Lifestyle Family Fitness had a private customer portal that allowed members to track their workout progress.
The technology behind this was impressive, but the design and implementation needed a lot of attention 
<em>(the brand colors were red white and black, but it was sporting a blue web 2.0 and/or Windows XP motif)</em>.
As an ongoing side project I created design comps to explore new ideas.
This included aggregating pre-existing data from blogs, social media, and personal training videos, 
and bringing them all together in one cohesive, on-brand, package.
