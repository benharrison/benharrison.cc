The Pizza Plus daily prize game was completely re-written to resolve some flaws in the 
previous (and <em>very</em> popular) prize game. Users could cheat the system by deleting
their cookies, and web admins could not modify the prizes or odds.

My version was created with Flash and ActionScript 3, but relied on a server-side solution
to handle game logic and log gameplay attempts. Through the admin panel an unlimited number
of prizes could be created, and their corresponding odds and availability could be easily
modified.
