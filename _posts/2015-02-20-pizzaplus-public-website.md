The second of two major redesigns I had done for the public Pizza Plus site was designed
with several goals in mind. It had to be clean, practical, and dead simple for customers to use.
But most importantly the front-end code had to be versatile enough to seamlessly support online ordering,
when it became available. The idea was to be able to jump between servers and subdomains while
maintaining a consistent user experience. The template could easily be migrated to any other CMS or back-end system.
