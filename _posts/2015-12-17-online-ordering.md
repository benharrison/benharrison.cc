A multi-tenant white-label online ordering system that serves the restaurant industry.

I've designed, architected, and developed the full technology stack.
Independently responsible for all aspects of the system ranging from user-interface design, 
business services, back-end database, and server management.

The strategy for re-branding the customer interface was to build a code structure reasonably inspired by CSS Zen Garden.
This provides brands the flexibility to achieve a distinct look by offering more than a logo, background, and color replacement.
