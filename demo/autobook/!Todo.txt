AutoBook User Interface Upgrade

Goal: Distinguish the scheduling application as one of the flagship products of the AutoLoop software suite.

The application is unique to the rest of AutoLoop due to it's underlying nature as a JavaScript and Ajax intensive application, but also more importantly because of the high level of interactivity from our users; the customers. For these reasons it is very important to place an emphasis on the user experience. By removing certain technical dependencies and visual connections to AutoLoop, the scheduling application could make significant improvements to the overall end-user experience while establishing its own identity as a member of the AutoLoop family of software products.

Certain steps have already been taken to separate the scheduling application from AutoLoop. It is using a separate and dedicated Master Page. JavaScript and CSS resources that aren't necessary for AutoBook to function are carefully being omitted from this Master Page, to cut down on JavaScript bloat. Core JavaScript libraries such as jQuery and jQueryUI are being loaded from the Google CDN, which also gives additional performance benefits. However, there are also certain design and aesthetic problems that need attention.

Currently the scheduling application has no identity within the software, only through marketing materials. It appears and feels like one of the many features of the AutoLoop product rather than a software application that can potentially stand alone. Design decisions are limited by maintaining an identical cohesiveness with the rest of AutoLoop. A new design can give the flexibility to creatively solve visual problems within scheduler while remaining true to form and staying within the same "visual family".
